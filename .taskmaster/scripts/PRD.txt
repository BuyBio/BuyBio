## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# Overview
BUYO (Bio Uniting You and Opportunities) is a specialized mobile application that democratizes biotechnology investment information for individual retail investors in South Korea. The platform addresses the critical information asymmetry problem where institutional investors have exclusive access to professional bio investment data, while individual investors struggle with complex technical terminology, fragmented data sources, and lack of real-time insights.

**Problem Statement:** Individual investors face significant barriers when investing in biotechnology stocks due to:
- Complex technical terminology (CAR-T, ADC, clinical trial phases)
- Fragmented information across multiple sources (DART, KIPRIS, securities reports)
- Lack of real-time notifications for critical events (FDA approvals, clinical failures)
- Information lag compared to institutional investors
- Difficulty interpreting clinical data and patent information

**Target Users:** 
- Primary: Active individual investors (ages 20-40) with 30%+ portfolio allocation to bio stocks
- Secondary: Bio investment beginners seeking educational guidance
- Tertiary: Institutional investors requiring efficient data aggregation tools

**Value Proposition:** Transform complex biotechnology investment data into personalized, real-time, actionable insights through AI curation and pharmaceutical expert validation, enabling informed investment decisions at 30-50% lower cost than existing premium services.

# Core Features
